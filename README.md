# Langgraph Anshul Virmani 2210110172 MAT496

**Module 1**

Video 1: Motivation

I learned that LangGraph helps overcome the usual limitations of language models, especially their lack of access to tools and external context like documentation. The video also talked about how basic LLMs fall short in certain tasks and introduced the idea of control flow. I also got a clearer understanding of chain architecture and agent architecture.
